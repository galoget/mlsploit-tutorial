  summary: |
    SHIELD addresses the urgent need for practical defense that can be readily deployed to combat attacks in real-time. It places JPEG compression at the core of our proposed SHIELD defense framework, utilizing its capability to effectively "compress away" such pixel manipulation. 
    
    <ul>
    <li>SHIELD "vaccinates" a model by re-training it with compressed images, where different compression levels are applied to generate multiple vaccinated models that are ultimately used together in an ensemble defense.</li>
    
    <li>SHIELD adds an additional layer of protection by employing randomization at test time that compresses different regions of an image using random compression levels, making it harder for an adversary to estimate the transformation performed.</li>

    <li>Extensive large-scale experiments using the ImageNet dataset shows that SHIELD eliminates up to 94% of black-box attacks and 98% of gray-box attacks delivered by the recent, strongest attacks, such as Carlini-Wagner's L2 and DeepFool.</li>
    
    <li>SHIELD's novel fortified multi-pronged approach is fast and works without requiring knowledge about the model.</li>
    </ul>
